## Program Description:

Our Program Takes the users name and age and converts that age (in years) to the number of days and seconds old. This is a rough estimate as it doesn't account for leap years and how many days out of their current age they have lived. One would use it by inputting their name and age when prompted by the IDE. If one would want to contribute to it, they must abide by the license and code-of-conduct.
